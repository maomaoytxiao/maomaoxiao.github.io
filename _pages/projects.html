        <h2>Deep Learning-Based Identification and Extraction of Tomato Leaf Diseases</h2>
        <p>
          This report introduces a project that uses data mining techniques to identify and predict tomato diseases.
          The project mainly consists of data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, optimization, and deployment. 
          The report will detail the implementation methods for each step, the challenges encountered, and how to solve these problems. 
          Ultimately, we successfully built a model that can effectively identify and predict tomato diseases, bringing practical application value to the agricultural field.
