        <h2>Deep Learning-Based Identification and Extraction of Tomato Leaf Diseases</h2>
        <p>
          This project employs data mining techniques for the identification and prediction of tomato diseases. <br>
          It is a comprehensive process that primarily involves stages 
          such as <strong>data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, optimization, and deployment.</strong> <br>
          My goal is to construct a robust model that can effectively identify and predict tomato diseases, thereby delivering tangible benefits to the agricultural sector.<br>
