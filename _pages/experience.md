# Work experience
======
* ## Research Technician                                              Aug, 2021- Present
  * [Taiwan Agricultural Chemicals and Toxic Substances Research Institute](https://www.tactri.gov.tw/En#gsc.tab=0)
    * Co-led the project of Establishment of carbon emission coefficient in biochar and pesticide use: conducted the pest
                predictive lethal model by R and analyzed carbon emission coefficient data in biochar and pesticide use.
    * In charge of the Bacillus thuringiensis bioassay inspections (10 inspections per month); optimized the bio-
                 pesticide inspections in export and import products by R to expedite the efficiency of the data analysis period
                 (from 24 hours into 1 hour).
    * Led the project of Strengthening safe and off-season vegetable production in Cambodia-application of biopesticides
                and biofertilizers: inventoried the main plant deceases, to which the efficacy of pesticides was tested, 
                and cooperated with World Vegetable Center to conduct field tests.

* ## Food Chemistry Technician/ Research Assistant                      Dec, 2019- July, 2021
  * [Taichung District Agricultural Research and Extension Station](https://www.tdais.gov.tw/en/)
    * In charge of the project of Development of Fodder and Functional Microorganisms in Reuse and Value-adding of By-
                Products in Crops Processing: singlehandedly designed and executed project, analyzed statistical data (by R) and
                wrote the report, and developed functional grain products.
    * Refined the agriculture practices for the medicinal plant Echinacea.
    * Built the plant disease diagnosis Line Chatbot system (by Python) to automatically examine the photos sent by
                 users and generate a pre-diagnosis to identify the type of disease and pathogenbstances.
    * Created classroom materials about fungicide treatments and crop disease management.
    * Analyzed and surveyed at least 500 pathogens in grape rot disease.
    
* ## Research Assistant                                                   July, 2017- Dec, 2018
  * [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/)
   * Investigated the pathogen outbreaks in Annona fruits and formulated the control plan.
   * Conducted molecular breeding to create optimized variety for genetic resistance against Magnaporthe oryzae in rice.
   *  Studied the transcriptome of brown root rot disease and the bio-control mechanisms for Trichoderma spp. to Phellinus noxius in brown root rot disease.
   * Upgraded early detection techniques for brown root disease in trees via metabolomics analyses of leaves.
   * Used molecular markers and sifted through the genes of all banana varieties in Taiwan to identify the genome of
                Panama disease‚Äôs pathogen.
